- Matt here! I'm an old-school computer nerd from the DOS and OS/2 era who made the move to UNIX-based Macs around the turn of the century, dabbled in Linux- and *BSD-based environments since then, and am ready to explore what's new in modern web-oriented development! I'm currently learning my way around the GitHub environment and related systems... stay tuned for more!
